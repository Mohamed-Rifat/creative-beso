          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Iâ€™m Basem Raafat â€” a graduate of the Faculty of Mass Communication, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, class of 2021. This is where the foundation was laid for every step that would turn into tangible work.

          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            In 2021, my voice opened the first door. I began as a voice-over artist, then as a creative copywriter, and within a year, I worked on diverse projects for ads, promos, and content both inside and outside Egypt.

          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            In 2023, I took practical steps to grow and advance in the job market by managing client accounts as an "account manager" at one of the largest advertising agencies. This opportunity allowed me to transform ideas and creative concepts into campaigns across TV, radio, and digitalâ€”working with numerous brands across various industries.

          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            By early 2024, I was promoted to Business Developer. While building content and ideas, I was also crafting business strategies. My responsibilities expanded to delivering comprehensive (B2B & B2C) content solutions with a skilled team behind me.
